Description:
  This allocator is a shim that replaces the standard malloc, calloc, realloc,
    and free functions with implementations that function according to the
    specification of the originals.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
  The allocator only works for values up to 4 Gigabytes. Behavior when the size
  parameter of malloc, realloc, and calloc is greater than 4 gigabytes is
  undefined.
  - Because this allocator will not be dealing with values any larger
    than 4GB, this saves a little bit of space in the header of each page.

DESIGN
  In working on this project, I put most of my effort into making my new
  malloc and free functions. After testing and debugging these sufficiently,
  using them to make my realloc and calloc functions was a simple task.
